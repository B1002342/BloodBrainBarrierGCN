# BloodBrainBarrierGCN

In this project, we train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on molecular data represented as SMILES
(Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings, specifically focusing on the structural
features that determine Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability. By analyzing a curated dataset
of nicotine derivatives, our model provides insight into the molecular features that influence BBB
penetration, offering a stepping stone toward designing safer nicotine analogs. The goal of this work
is not merely to predict BBB permeability but to interpret the underlying molecular patterns that
differentiate compounds that cross the barrier from those that do not.
